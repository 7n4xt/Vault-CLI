🧱 Step 1 — Create the Project Structure

Make your folders and files first — even empty ones.
From your terminal:

mkdir -p vaultcli/vaultcli
mkdir vaultcli/tests
touch vaultcli/vaultcli/__init__.py
touch vaultcli/vaultcli/{cli.py,storage.py,encryption.py,auth.py,password_gen.py,utils.py}
touch vaultcli/tests/{test_storage.py,test_encryption.py,test_auth.py}
touch vaultcli/requirements.txt
touch vaultcli/conventions.md
touch vaultcli/README.md


Now your structure looks professional, even before writing a single line of code.

⚙️ Step 2 — Create a Minimal CLI Entry Point

Start small — you want something that runs when you type a command.
In cli.py, just write a few placeholder lines later (we’ll do that soon).
For now, decide whether you’ll use argparse (built-in, simple) or click (nicer syntax).
If you’re new to Python, argparse is totally fine and great practice.

🧠 Step 3 — Define the Core Commands You’ll Implement

Think of what your CLI should be able to do once it’s complete.
You don’t write them yet — just plan them.

Example commands:

setup → Create master password & vault file.

add → Add a new credential.

get → Retrieve credentials.

list → Show all saved entries.

delete → Remove an entry.

generate → Create a random password.

You’ll eventually connect each to a function in a different module.
(That’s the point of modular design.)

🔒 Step 4 — Start with the Foundation: Authentication

Before encryption, before data — start with master password setup.
You’ll write code to:

Ask the user for a master password (using getpass).

Hash it (using hashlib or bcrypt).

Save the hash locally (so you can verify it later).

This gives your program a sense of identity — a first real feature.

💾 Step 5 — Next, Move to Storage

After you can verify the user, create the functions to save and load the vault.
For now, you can store data as plain JSON — encryption comes next.
This lets you test reading/writing logic safely before adding complexity.

🔐 Step 6 — Implement Encryption

When the basic vault works, replace your plain save/load logic with encrypted storage using the cryptography library (Fernet).
You’ll encrypt the entire JSON blob, not each password individually.

🧩 Step 7 — Add Commands One by One

Once the core (auth + storage + encryption) works, add your commands gradually:

add

get

list

delete

(Optional) generate

Test each as you go.

🧪 Step 8 — Add Tests

Every time you finish one module (like encryption.py), write one or two tests for it.
Don’t wait until the end — you’ll learn more by testing early.

🧼 Step 9 — Polish & Document

Add:

A short README.md (project purpose, usage examples).

Run black for formatting and ruff or flake8 for linting.

Update requirements.txt with what you used (cryptography, maybe rich).

🚀 Step 10 — Package It

Once it’s working, make it installable:

Add setup.py

Then run pip install -e . inside the project folder.
Now you can run your CLI from anywhere with:

vault


So in short, the right order to start is:

Structure → Authentication → Storage → Encryption → Commands → Tests → Polish

If you want, I can help you plan the first implementation phase (the authentication part) — I’ll guide you through what functions to create, their purpose, and data flow (without giving the code).
